# PIC16F87XA Microcontroller 

This repository contains various code examples for different modes and peripherals of the PIC16F87XA microcontroller along with their simulation in Proteus software.


## Simulation

Each code example in this repository comes with a Proteus simulation file. Proteus is a software that allows you to simulate and test your electronic circuits before implementing them in hardware. With the Proteus simulation file provided for each code example, you can easily test and verify the functionality of the code without the need for physical hardware.

## Requirements

To run the code examples and simulations in this repository, you will need the following:

- PIC16F87XA microcontroller
- MPLAB X IDE software
- Proteus software

## Usage

To use the code examples and simulations in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Open the MPLAB X IDE software and import the code example you want to run.
3. Build the code and generate the hex file.
4. Open the Proteus simulation file for the code example you want to test.
5. Load the hex file into the microcontroller in the Proteus simulation.
6. Run the simulation to test the code.
