# PIC16F87XA
This repository contains various code examples for different modes and peripherals of the PIC16F87XA microcontroller along with their simulation in Proteus software.

# Simulation
Each code example in this repository comes with a Proteus simulation file. Proteus is a software that allows you to simulate and test your electronic circuits before implementing them in hardware. With the Proteus simulation file provided for each code example, you can easily test and verify the functionality of the code without the need for physical hardware.

# Requirements
To run the code examples and simulations in this repository, you will need the following:

PIC16F87XA microcontroller
MPLAB X IDE software
Proteus software

# Usage
